# BikeSharing

## Overview:

On a vacation trip to NYC, we biked around all major landmarks which helped us to get to know the city and its culture much better than a regular tourist. We also interacted with regular bike riders who mostly use Citibike to commute to work. Citibike is the nations largest bike share program, which was designed with convenience and affordability in mind. Biking is the most affordable transportation in the world's most expensive city Manhattan.This got me thinking if a bike sharing venture will be successful in my hometown of Des Moines. Few questions popped in my head that need to be answered like the total number of trips in a year, who would be riding bike more often or like what are the peak hours and finally maintenance time period to up keep the bikes.

Tableau is a powerful analytical and visualization tool that provides easy to understand dashboards for technical and non-technical audience. Tableau visualizations provide analysts a way to tell a clear story and easily share their analysis with the investors or the management teams.

## Summary

The below are the findings from the above analysis:

1. Peak times for Male riders are 6am-10am and 5pm-7pm.
2. Workday trips are heavier during peak hours for both Male and Female bike Riders.
3. User Trips by Gender by Weekday(Males are highest annual subscirbers as they bike ride to work on weekdays and bike ride for leisure/fitness during weekends.
4. Bike maintenance is a must for the business to avoid unwanted expenses and loss in business. As per the chart bike repairs are best during off peak hrs like 2am-     5am.

Bike sharing business in a very small downtown of Des Moines could be successfull based on various factors. 

We would have to do more analysis like:
1. Which stations are more popular as starting and ending locations?
2. Which seasons are the most efficient for bike riders to commute? I believe on a rainy day we could see a dip in the rentals, also we need to compare winter vs summer seasons to get a full picture of the business.
